                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>I'm currently in my second semester of Front-end development at <a href="https://www.noroff.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media</a>. So far, I've completed the courses: Design, html and CSS, Javascript 1 and Agency 1. I've learned a lot during my studies and had the chance to meet a lot of great and talented people. The course that stands out to me the most is Agency 1, where we had to work as a group, as well as collaborating with other groups. I'm very curious about learning more about Agile Methodology in future courses.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy to reading books (mostly in the fantasy genre), playing video games, playing Dungeons & Dragons and hang out with friends. I also work full time at an elementary school, in an after school program. I work with children in the age group 5 - 9 years old, as well as staff managing. My life can be pretty hectic, but in a good way, and studying front-end development have been challenging but also extremely rewarding and fun.</p>
